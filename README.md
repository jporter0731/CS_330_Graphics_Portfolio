# How do I approach designing software?
**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?** <br />
I learned a lot in this course and it has challenged me more than any computer science course has so far. I had to restart this project three times (because of my own stupidity) and that alone has taught me how to be resiliant and to keep trying and eventually everything will work out. More importantly, I learned how to create and orginize objects within a scene and how to render them with movement within the scene. <br />
**What design process did you follow for your project work?** <br />
I really don't feel like I had a very orginized design process, but by having a totally unorginized design process, I learned what not to do. From that I feel like it is best to work in layers with a project. First, setup the window details, then you can setup the basic objects and move to advanced objects. With the last couple of steps involving adding textures and ligthing to our scenes. <br />
**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?** <br />
To be 100% honest, I do not ever want to work on graphics projects after taking this course, but there is still a lot I can learn from this course. In my future projects, I know that it works best working in simple smaller layers and building up to the more complex concepts. <br />
# How do I approach developing programs?
**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?** <br />
I used a lot of development startegies when working on my 3-D scene that helped me succeed in this course. I took my time where necessary and referenced the book when I was confucsed. I also made sure to review all of the extra resources when I needed more clarification. One thing that would have made my time in this course a little easier would have been watching the weekly webinars to help me better prepare for the assignements. <br />
**How did iteration factor into your development?** <br />
Iteration played a HUGE factor in the development of this scene. Without proper iteration there is no way on Earth that I would have finished this project on time. It is very important that we took this project in a section by section process, and then at the end we finally have a finished scene with all of the required details. <br />
**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?** <br />
My approach to developing code didn't change too much, but there were concepts that were better reinforced through the development of this project. The biggest evolution in this term was in my appretaion for iteration. I also tested my patients and willingness to keep going this term and my resolve has deffinately increased through this project development. <br />
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?** <br />
The biggest thing that I learned in this course that will help me with the rest of my education is to keep on trying. After the first half of this term, I was in a very rough position, but by the end, I knew enough to at least get the job done. <br />
**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?** <br />
As I have said before, I hope to never have to work with graphics again, but know it will inevitablly happen. There are countless practical real world applications of graphics that I can see being very beneficial. AS with my educational skills and knowledge, my biggest skill gained was the ability to keep trying until I get where I need to. I also learned that there is a time when starting over is the best option to give you the highest probability of sucess. <br />
